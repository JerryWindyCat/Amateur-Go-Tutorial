# Amateur-Go-Tutorial

Hi fellas! I'm JerryWindyCat, a 5-dan amateur Go player in China, TYGEM 9D since 2011.
This is a tutorial for beginners to become good at Go. When I'm done, it will work for all amateur players below Fox 7D.
I write all the tutorials based on my own experience, and in my spare time, so I don't know how long it'll take. But I'll try to finish it soon :P

No coding involved, just so you know :) I can't code at all :)
If you guys want to code you should try Lizzie, the Interface of LeelaZero by Annie Wagner ~ 
For other information see the document "Introduction for the repository" :)

Feel free to contact me for any Go-related discussions, 
or to send your SGF format game records to jerrywindycat@163.com to ask for my review ~
Completely free and I will try to finish in time ~
