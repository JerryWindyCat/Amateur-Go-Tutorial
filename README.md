# Amateur-Go-Tutorial

Hi fellas! I'm JerryWindyCat, a 5-dan amateur Go player in China, TYGEM 9D since 2011.
This is a tutorial for beginners to become good at Go. When I'm done, it will work for all amateur players below Fox 7D.
I write all the tutorials based on my own experience, so I don't know how long it takes. I'll try to finish it fast :P
No coding involved, just so you know :) I can't code at all :)
You guys can also try Lizzie, Interface of LeelaZero by Annie Wagner ~ it's a really helpful tool~
For other information see the document "Introduction for the repository" :)
